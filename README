The MicroC compiler

Coded in OCaml, this takes a highly stripped-down subset of C (ints,
bools, and void types, arithmetic, if-else, for, and while statements,
and user-defined functions) and compiles it into LLVM IR.

It needs the OCaml llvm library, which is most easily installed through opam.

Install LLVM and its development libraries, the m4 macro preprocessor,
and opam, then use opam to install llvm.

The version of the OCaml llvm library should match the version of the LLVM
system installed on your system.

------------------------------
Installation under Ubuntu 14.04

The default LLVM package is 3.4, so we install the matching OCaml library
using opam.

sudo apt-get install m4 llvm llvm-devel

sudo add-apt-repository --yes ppa:avsm/ppa
sudo apt-get update -qq
sudo apt-get install -y opam
opam init

eval `opam config env`

opam install llvm.3.4

------------------------------
Installation under OS X

1. Install Homebrew:

   ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"

2. Verify Homebrew is installed correctly:

   brew doctor

3. Install opam:

   brew install opam

4. Set up opam:

   opam init

5. Install llvm:

   brew install llvm

   Take note of where brew places the llvm executables. It will show
   you the path to them under the CAVEATS section of the post-install
   terminal output. For me, they were in /usr/local/opt/llvm/bin. Also
   take note of the llvm version installed. For me, it was 3.6.2.

6. Have opam set up your enviroment:

   eval `opam config env`

7. Install the OCaml llvm library:

   opam install llvm.3.6 

   Ensure that the version of llvm you install here matches the
   version you installed via brew. Brew installed llvm version 3.6.2,
   so I install llvm.3.6 with opam.

   IF YOU HAVE PROBLEMS ON THIS STEP, it's probably because you are
   missing some external dependencies. Ensure that libffi is installed
   on your machine. It can be installed via the following command:
   brew install libffi. If, after this, opam install llvm.3.6
   is still not working, try running the following command:

   opam list --external --required-by=llvm.3.6

   This will list all of the external dependencies required by
   llvm.3.6. Install all the dependencies listed by this command.

8. Create a symbolic link to the lli command:

   sudo ln -s /usr/local/opt/llvm/bin/lli /usr/bin/lli

   Create the symlink from wherever brew installs the llvm executables
   and place it in your bin. From step 5, I know that brew installed
   the lli executable in the folder, /usr/local/opt/llvm/bin/, so this
   is where I symlink to. Brew might install the lli executables in a
   different location for you, so make sure you symlink to the right
   directory.

9. To run and test, navigate to the MicroC folder. Once there, run

   make ; ./testall.sh

  MicroC should build without any complaints and all tests should
  pass.
